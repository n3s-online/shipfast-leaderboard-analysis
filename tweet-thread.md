I analyzed the landing page headlines of the top 100 startups on @marc_lou's ShipFast leaderboard.

Collectively, they make $2.7M+ in revenue.

Out of the 81 English headlines from top 100 startups, only 8 words showed up more than twice:

6√ó ‚Äî build, ai
4√ó ‚Äî app, videos, minutes, startup
3√ó ‚Äî idea, boost

Learnings:
1. ‚ÄúMinutes‚Äù and ‚Äúseconds‚Äù beat ‚Äúinstantly‚Äù ‚Äî believable speed > magic, don't market as too good to be true
2. ‚ÄúAI‚Äù still dominates

I ran sentiment analysis on the 81 English startup headlines:
- 59% neutral
- 35% positive
- 6% negative

Positive headlines drive the most revenue on average.
Negative headlines have the highest _median_ revenue.

What should you do? It seems like the data leans towards neutral headlines (leaning positive) having the best odds of success. Don't over-sell your product or market via fear.

### Tweet 6
Obvious but confirmed: none of the top 100 ShipFast startups used a question as their headline. Every single one was a statement.

Questions create doubt.

Statements build authority.
### Tweet 7
I asked ChatGPT to label each headline as either feature-focused (e.g. ‚ÄúGenerate videos with AI‚Äù) or benefit-focused (e.g. ‚ÄúGrow faster with AI-generated videos‚Äù).

Result: it barely matters.

Benefit-driven headlines were 48.9% of the total and brought in 49.7% of revenue.

Slight edge, not a silver bullet.

### Tweet 8
I had ChatGPT extract the top ‚Äúbenefit keywords‚Äù from each headline.

Most common:
boost, profitable, seconds, accurate, easy, stunning, simple, efficient, digital, conversions

Speed, clarity, and outcomes dominate.

### Tweet 9
I had ChatGPT identify which headlines included statistics  (ex: "46% of Google Search is Local" - https://shiplocal.directory @mattmerrick16 $2,346).

Only 6 of the top 100 used statistics. On average, they made 80% less revenue than those that didn‚Äôt.

Data usually beats opinion - but not when its in the headline.
