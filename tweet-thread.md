Your SaaS's headline is the first thing most customers will see.

I dissected the top 100 startups on @marc_louvion's ShipFast leaderboard (collectively $2.7 M+ ARR) to uncover the headline formulas that convert.

Full thread with takeaways and 100 headline examplesüëá

Be confident but realistic about your product. Include industry trends.

Out of the 81 English headlines from top 100 startups, only 8 words showed up more than twice:

6x: build, ai
4x: app, videos, minutes, startup
3x: idea, boost

"Minutes" > "Instantly" (its more believable)

Data shows that the majority of successful headlines are neutral, and the rest are positive.

I ran sentiment analysis on the 81 English startup headlines:
- 59% neutral
- 35% positive
- 6% negative

Don't over-sell your product.
Don't market via fear.
Be realistic.

Use statements, not questions. 
Statements project authority, questions invite doubt.

ZERO of the top 100 ShipFast startups used a question as their headline. Every single one was a statement.

### Tweet 7
I asked ChatGPT to label each headline as either feature-focused (e.g. ‚ÄúGenerate videos with AI‚Äù) or benefit-focused (e.g. ‚ÄúGrow faster with AI-generated videos‚Äù).

Result: it barely matters.

Benefit-driven headlines were 48.9% of the total and brought in 49.7% of revenue.

Slight edge, not a silver bullet.

### Tweet 8
I had ChatGPT extract the top ‚Äúbenefit keywords‚Äù from each headline.

Most common:
boost, profitable, seconds, accurate, easy, stunning, simple, efficient, digital, conversions

Speed, clarity, and outcomes dominate.

Data usually beats opinion - but not when its in the headline.

I had ChatGPT identify which headlines included statistics  (ex: "46% of Google Search is Local" - https://shiplocal.directory @mattmerrick16 $2,346).

Only 6 of the top 100 used statistics. On average, they made 80% less revenue than those that didn‚Äôt.
